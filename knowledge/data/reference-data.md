# Schema

- **Reference data** — the game rulebook (characters, weapons, sets, stat tables) from a
  frozen `genshin-db` snapshot. It never reads a player's account.
- **Inventory** — the [artifacts](/domain/artifact.md) a player owns, loaded into the app via:
  - **GOOD file** (primary) — the community inventory-export JSON produced by scanners; full inventory.
  - **UID** (convenience) — showcased characters only, via Enka.Network.

The frozen snapshot guarantees deterministic, reproducible results and decouples the app from
any live API.
