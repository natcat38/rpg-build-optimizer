# Schema

`genshinAdapter` is the single concrete object that exposes Genshin data to the rest of
the app: characters, weapons, sets, base stats, and main-stat values. The
[optimiser](/components/optimiser.md), import, and share layers import it directly. It also
owns universal game-wide baselines — e.g. the 100% base Energy Recharge every character
starts from — rather than the frozen [reference data](/data/reference-data.md) snapshot.

It was originally a `GameAdapter` interface intended to let a second game slot in behind the
same seam ([ADR-0008](../../docs/adr/0008-gameadapter-seam-for-multi-game.md)). With only one
game ever implemented and no caller overriding the default, the interface was collapsed to
this concrete adapter ([ADR-0012](../../docs/adr/0012-collapse-gameadapter-seam-to-concrete-adapter.md)).
