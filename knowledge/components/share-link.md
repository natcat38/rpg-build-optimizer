# Schema

A share link is the entire **build snapshot** encoded into a URL — character, weapon, build
level, five full [artifacts](/domain/artifact.md), [constraints](/domain/constraint.md),
[objective](/domain/objective.md), and meta target. Because the app is client-side only,
the link itself is the storage: opening it reconstructs the exact state with no server call.
