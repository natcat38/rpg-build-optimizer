/**
 * The five artifact-slot marks, as inline SVG.
 *
 * These started life as five Unicode characters (✿ ⟁ ⧖ ♟ ◆). None of the three
 * webfonts this app loads — Space Grotesk, Spline Sans, IBM Plex Mono — carries
 * U+27C1, U+29D6 or U+265F, so every one of them fell through to whatever the
 * platform happened to have: five different shapes, five different optical
 * weights, on three different operating systems. A mark set the product uses as
 * a signature can't be a coin flip on the reader's font stack, so they are
 * drawn here instead.
 *
 * Same visual language as the characters they replace — organic flower,
 * triangle, hourglass, diamond — with one deliberate change: the Goblet was a
 * chess pawn (♟) purely because no goblet codepoint was to hand, and is now an
 * actual chalice.
 *
 * Filled silhouettes rather than strokes: these render at 14–18px, where a
 * sub-pixel stroke turns to grey mush.
 *
 * Always decorative. Every call site sits beside the slot's own text label, so
 * the `aria-hidden` here is not a shortcut — a second reading of "Flower" is
 * noise, not access.
