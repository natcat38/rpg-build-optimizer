/**
 * Curated 4-piece set bonuses, modelled at **full uptime / max stacks**
 * (ADR-0020, amending ADR-0003's "conditional 4pc effects are not scored").
 *
 * The table is hand-curated content, like `DAMAGE_PROFILES` and `META_TARGETS`:
 * the frozen `genshin-db` snapshot carries only the flat-stat 2-piece bonuses
 * (every `sets[].fourPiece` in `data.generated.json` is absent), because a 4pc
 * effect is prose, not a stat vector. Turning that prose into a number is a
 * judgement call, so it lives here with its assumption written down next to it.
 *
 * ## The two channels
 *
 * - **`sheet`** — a flat sheet stat the effect reduces to at full uptime
 *   (Crimson Witch's three stacks are just "+22.5% Pyro DMG"). Honest for any
 *   objective, so it feeds the **scalar** pruning path as well as the damage
 *   engine.
 * - **`hitDmg` / `burstDmgFromEr`** — a DMG% bonus restricted to one or more
 *   hit kinds (Gladiator's "+35% Normal Attack DMG"). These are *not* sheet
 *   stats and never reach a scalar objective; they are folded into
 *   `elemental_dmg` **only** for the `avg_damage` objective, weighted by the
 *   share of the character's damage profile that the restricted hit kinds
 *   account for. See `fourPieceVector` for why that is an approximation.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not modelled
 *
 * `UNMODELLED_FOUR_PIECE` lists, with a reason, every meta-relevant set whose
 * 4pc has no honest self-buff number: enemy RES shred (a team effect, and the
 * enemy config is a constant across candidate builds anyway), transformative-
 * reaction bonuses (excluded by ADR-0016), and effects that scale off healing
 * or team composition rather than the wearer's own sheet.
 *
 * Freshness: transcribed against snapshot patch 6.7. `source` is the set's
 * Fandom wiki page; the bonus text was cross-read against community build
 * guides. Re-check on a patch refresh (`docs/runbooks/patch-refresh.md`).
